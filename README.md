# Image-Steganalysis-with-Binary-Similarity-Measures
 Detection of hidden messages and data in images
 
 -Utilized linear, bipolar, RBF kernels to obtain the most sufficient results.
 -Utilitzed k-fold method with k=5
 -Utilized PVD and LSB to generate steganography database images
 -Utilized gussy noise to normlize steganogarphy database and close the results to reality
