# Image-Steganalysis-with-Binary-Similarity-Measures
 Detection of hidden messages and data in images
 
 - Utilized linear, bipolar, RBF kernels to obtain the most sufficient results.
 - Utilitzed k-fold method with k=5
 - Utilized PVD and LSB to generate steganography database images
 - Utilized gussy noise to normlize steganogarphy database and close the results to reality
