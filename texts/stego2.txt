It should be noted that the main goal of steganography is
to communicate securely in a completely undetectable manner.
That is, Wendy should not be able to distinguish in any sense
between cover-objects (objects not containing any secret mes-
sage) and stego-objects (objects containing a secret message). In
this context, “steganalysis” refers to the body of techniques that
are designed to distinguish between cover-objects and stego-ob-
jects. It should be noted that nothing might be gleaned about
the contents of the secret message . When the existence of
hidden message is known, revealing its content is not always
necessary. Just disabling and rendering it useless will defeat the
very purpose of steganography. In this paper, we present a ste-
ganalysis technique for detecting stego-images, i.e., still images
containing hidden messages, using image quality metrics. Al-
though we focus on images, the general techniques we discuss
would also be applicable to audio and video media.
