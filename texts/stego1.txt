STEGANOGRAPHY refers to the science of “invisible”
communication. Unlike cryptography, where the goal is to
secure communications from an eavesdropper, steganographic
techniques strive to hide the very presence of the message itself
from an observer. Although steganography is an ancient sub-
ject, the modern formulation of it is often given in terms of the
prisoner’s problem [1] where Alice and Bob are two inmates
who wish to communicate in order to hatch an escape plan.
